Which can be downloaded from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20181016150224/https://download.steinberg.net/sdk_downloads/vstsdk3610_11_06_2018_build_37.zip


The following dependencies are then included as git submodules:

If they are not there, then enter the following command:
git submodule update --init --recursive
